## Assignment Description

COMPX364/502 - Group Project Information

Welcome to your Cryptography Group Project, which is worth 20% of your overall mark.
The aim of this task is to produce, as a team, a computer program which can be used
to encrypt and decrypt messages involving the many examples that we have encountered
throughout the second half of this paper.

There is very much an opportunity to put your own spin on the above remit, in particular
with components of your program that might contain some “intelligent analysis” features.

### Cryptosystems you might include:

- Caesar cypher
- Simple Substitution
- Polygraphic Substitution
- Vigenere cypher
- Local Transposition
- Playfair cypher
- Feistel cypher,
- Massey-Omura
- R.S.A.
- ElGamal
- Knapsack Cypher
- etc.

### Features that might be useful:

- Encryption-decryption implementation,
- Index of Coincidence capabilities,
- Letter Frequency Calculator,
- Discrete Logarithm Solver,
- Factorisation Algorithms for Integers,
- Exhaustive Keyspace Searches,
- Periodicity Finder,
- Removal of Spaces and/or Capitals,
- Message Solver for Cyphertext,
- Key Solver for Cyphertext,
- etc.

I don’t expect you to include all these elements (indeed that would be exhausting), but I
am on the lookout for programs that demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topics we
have touched on in this course.

### Submission Info

The assessment will take place in Week 13 where you will be required to present your
program to the class as a whole; I will also prepare a number of cyphertext examples
which you will then unleash your program upon in order to decode them.

### Marking

Your final mark will be based on the quality of your code, how well it is commented, your
ability to answer questions about your code, the standard of your group presentation, and
the performance of your program in decyphering the encrypted data I challenge it with.
We will also meet weekly throughout the second half of the trimester so that we all know
where we are currently at, and also importantly what remains to be done.

### Warning

A number of people have developed code available online to perform most of
these functions – however, if you use somebody else’s code, then the mark that you obtain
will have the same numeric value whether there is a plus or minus sign in front of it!
